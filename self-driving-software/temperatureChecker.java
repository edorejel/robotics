/*
Convert a temperature checker into a rudimentary "AI" self-driving software application.
Do not get too fancy with this, it is not difficult.
Hints: 
(1) The streets are well maintained.
(2) We're on planet Earth.
(3) Use the weather, so your app is really "fancy."
(4) Think about tsunami's and floods, what would that do?
(5) Think about global warming, how would that affect your self-drive AI?
