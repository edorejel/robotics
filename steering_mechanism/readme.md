# Steering Mechanism Using Light

Using light to steer a vehicle instead of a steering wheel, this is a mechanism for it, using Arduino and CAD
- the assumption is, the steering mechanism would be adapted to the actual vehicle
- a steering wheel column is no longer required using this mechanism
- the user could control the steering of the vehicle using a light dimmer on their mobile device
- I haven't seen this idea, so assume it is the original idea on the concept. I also don't normally research vehicles, but intrinsically, I think most systems are similar.
- For this actual steering mechanism to be put into production, and placing it in a car or other vehicle, that act would presumably require patents and testing.
- It is safe to assume a normal steering wheel column mechanism is obsolete technology.
