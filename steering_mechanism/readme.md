# Steering Mechanism Using Light (Electricity)

Using light to steer a vehicle instead of a steering wheel, this is a mechanism for it, using Arduino and Tinker CAD
- the assumption is, the steering mechanism would be adapted to the actual vehicle
- a steering wheel column is no longer required using this mechanism
- the user could control the steering of the vehicle using a light dimmer on their Android mobile device, or iPhone, or iPad.
- this would essentially automatically "lock" the steering of the vehicle, to a person's mobile device, so their vehicle cannot get stolen or their vehicle is not drivable, if the mobile device is not nearby.
- I think similar systems could be made for vehicle acceleration and stopping, using light instead of traditional methods. I am not sure though, I would have to take a look at those systems.
- I haven't seen this idea, so assume it is the original idea on the concept. I also don't normally research vehicles, but intrinsically, I think most systems are similar.
- For this actual steering mechanism to be put into production, and placing it in a car or other vehicle, that act would presumably require patents and testing.
- It is safe to assume a normal steering wheel column mechanism is obsolete technology.
