# Steering Mechanism

Using light to steer a vehicle instead of a steering wheel, this is a mechanism for it, using Arduino and CAD
- the assumption is, the steering mechanism would be adapted to the actual vehicle
- a steering wheel column is no longer required using this mechanism
- the user could control the steering of the vehicle using a light dimmer on their mobile device
