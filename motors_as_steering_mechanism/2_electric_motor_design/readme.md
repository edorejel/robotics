# 2 Electric Motor Design

- Two electric motors can be used to power the tires instead of 4.
- The two electric motors are placed in the center of the vehicle (or robot) and connected to the tires. This would make the vehicle slightly less responsive since the electric motors would be away from the tires, and connected to the tires using axles.
- One electric motor is placed in the front of the vehicle and centered. The other electric motor is placed in the back of the vehicle and centered.
