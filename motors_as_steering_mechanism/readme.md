# Motors as Steering Mechanism (Assume Electric Vehicle Motors)

- The electric motors are located where the tires would be. Four electric motors for four tires. The electric motors each control the tires and the electric motors stop the vehicle. The tires go around the electric motors.
- The vehicle has no brakes and no steering.
- This type of vehicle could work in real life, so a steering mechanism could be created for it.
- The vehicle must make left and right turns using only its tires, and the tires cannot move left or right to make the turns. Probably could be done. Vehicle would have limited use. This is an interesting simulation.
- I think if the physics in hydroplaning are incorporated and turned into a steering mechanism, a traditional steering wheel and steering column is not needed. I will have to research this, but if the tires spin faster than normal and unevenly, the surface that the vehicle is on should not matter, and the vehicle should turn. The turning is what has to be controlled. Interesting concept.
- I think a tire anchor is automatically created when one tire stops spinning or spins at a slower rate than the other vehicle tires. Harnessing this built-in anchor into a steering mechanism for a vehicle would be a challenge. It's an interesting challenge, to steer a vehicle using only electric motors and no traditional steering mechanism.   
- The motors would do all the braking and all the steering.
- The traditional engine of a vehicle is made smaller to only power the tires instead of powering the entire car. Thus, power is most likely, directly delivered to the tires and converted into energy, possibly faster than the current model of cars.
- - This type of vehicle would significantly alter the "universal" equation describing what a vehicle should be.
- The motors are possibly attached to the tires, so the "tires are the motors." (Technically, this is slightly more logical than the current setup of cars, tires, and motors.)
- This type of vehicle could work in real life. It would be something different, and interesting.
- (Tinkercad model coming soon! Looks like there's a few "logic and physics puzzles" in this vehicle design to solve.)
