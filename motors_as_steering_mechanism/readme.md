# Motors as Steering Mechanism (Assume Electric Vehicle Motors)

- The motors are located where the tires would be. Four motors for four tires. The motors each control the tires and the motors stop the vehicle.
- The vehicle has no brakes and no steering.
- The motors do the braking and the steering.
- The traditional engine of a vehicle is made smaller to only power the tires instead of powering the entire car. Thus, power is most likely, directly delivered to the tires and converted into energy.
- This type of vehicle would significantly alter the "universal" equation describing what a vehicle should be.
