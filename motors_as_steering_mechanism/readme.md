# Motors as Steering Mechanism (Assume Electric Vehicle Motors)

- The motors are located where the tires would be. Four motors for four tires. The motors each control the tires and the motors stop the vehicle.
- The vehicle has no brakes and no steering.
- The motors do the braking and the steering.
- The traditional engine of a vehicle is made smaller to only power the tires instead of powering the entire car. Thus, power is most likely, directly delivered to the tires and converted into energy, possibly faster than the current model of cars.
- This type of vehicle would significantly alter the "universal" equation describing what a vehicle should be.
- The motors are possibly attached to the tires, so the "tires are the motors." (Technically, this is slightly more logical than the current setup of cars, tires, and motors.)
- This type of vehicle could work in real life. It would be something different, and interesting.
