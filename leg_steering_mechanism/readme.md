# Leg Anchoring as a Steering Mechanism

A robot that uses legs to steer. Similar to anchoring. Steering system created using Tinkercad.
- Left leg steers the robot left.
- Right leg steers the robot right.

# Left Leg Anchored Front View 

As the left leg is lowered, the vehicle eventually tilts on its right side. As the left leg is anchored, and with the tires moving forward, the vehicle changes direction. The vehicle could also turn in reverse.
