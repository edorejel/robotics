# Basic Arduino Servo Motor Tilt Sensor Connection

- The image below features a tilt sensor connected to a Servo motor.
- The remote control and LED have limited connection. Both are connected to the Servo Motor when Button 5 is pressed.
- Button 5 on the remote operates the top lid of the robot.
- The Servo motor opens it.
- The tilt sensor also operates the Servo motor. It servs as an anti-flip mechanism for when the robot flips over, it can pick itself back up.
