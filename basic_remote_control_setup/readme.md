# Arduino Basic Remote Control Setup

- A basic remote control setup using arduino and Tinkercad. Code included. Some functionality has been added.
- Descriptions in the pic. Assume an array or an array-list is used, when needed.
- Link to code here: [remote control setup code](https://github.com/edorejel/robotics/blob/main/basic_remote_control_setup/remote_control_setup_code.cpp)

# Detailed Arduino Basic Remote Control Setup

- A more detailed setup diagram is provided. These details would be provided using algorithms and code, for system and resource accuracy.
- A central assumption is that the current, as shown, is enough to power the system shown regardless of how the wiring is setup. Thus, no other optimizations need to be taken into account.
