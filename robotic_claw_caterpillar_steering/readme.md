# Robotic Claw "Caterpillar Style" Steering Mechanism

A robotic claw can also be used to change the direction of a vehicle robot. The claw should be sturdy for this task.

- The claw is placed on top of the vehicle, and "plants" down to change direction, thereby, lifting the vehicle, and turning it to the desired direction.
- I suppose a real life vehicle can be made with this type of attachment, as long as it was modified and used for specific tasks.
- For the real life vehicle, it would be more practical have spider legs to assist in mobility over certain terrain.
