# Prototype Robot Tinkercad Circuit Board

- Final Robot Circuit Board Design
- Two motors will spin the tires and steer the robot.
- All code compiles without errors and both motors spin with this design. Code file coming soon.
- All sensors appear to be in the right slots. Code is required to connect them with the motors.
- No optimized code is used and optimizations are not considered.
- Tilt sensor is now connected to correct slot on Arduino. Tilt sensor controls the Servo motor to initiate the anti-flip mechanism.
- Servo motor also controlled via remote button, to open lid of the robot's compartment.

#1 Rough mock-up of the robot's circuit board.

- This design just has the robot going forward and backwards. Not ideal, since it is only one motor spinning the rear tires. The robot won't turn unless rear tires can be "pinned or anchored" independently.
- The angle sensor is there (the little green sensor towards the right). When the robot flips over, the angle sensor detects it.
