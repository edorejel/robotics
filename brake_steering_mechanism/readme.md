# Brake Steering Mechanism

Using brakes to change the direction of a robot. Similar to anchoring with legs to change direction.

This is an interesting system wherein brakes are used to change the direction of the vehicle. The system has not been researched, but I think anti-lock brakes operate under a similar principle. Seems like it would be fun to test out.
